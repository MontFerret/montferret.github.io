Hello Ferret users!

We are happy to announce the release of Ferret v0.18.0.

A small but useful update with a mix of maintenance and a new utility function.

# What’s new
- Updated project dependencies
- Added the TO_BINARY function (#775)

This release keeps things fresh under the hood while introducing a handy new helper for working with binary data. 

As always, thanks to everyone contributing and reporting issues.
