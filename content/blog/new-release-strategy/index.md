Working on an open source project while you have a full time job sometimes is challenging.    
Especially, when you try to make every release full of new features and bug fixes.    

Recent Ferret releases have showed, that trying to bring many features at one time is very time consuming and frustrating for end users. Therefore, our team has decided to change our release strategy.

In order to ship new releases more frequently, we are going to decrease amount of features and bug fixes per release. Ferret is more or less stable and featureful now, there are no reasons to wait too long.    

From now on, we are going to release new versions with only 1 or 2 features at a time, that should improve feedback loop and help us to react to any problems more quickly.

Thank you.
