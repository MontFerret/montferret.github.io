      <description>What is Ferret? Ferret project is an ambitious initiative trying to bring the universal platform for writing scrapers without any hassle. It aims to simplify data extraction from the web for UI testing, machine learning, analytics and more.
Ferret allows you to focus on the data by abstracting away the technical details and complexity of underlying technologies using its own declarative language.
Ferret is extremely portable, extensible and fast.</description>

      <description>What is Ferret Query Language? The Ferret Query Language (FQL) is heavily inspired by the ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) and used as a starting point. But due to the domain specifics, there are some differences in how things work and future lagnuage changes are expected.
Even though, FQL is used to read data from the websites, it&amp;rsquo;s considered as a general purpose query language. That means that all web related functionality is implemented as functions from the FQL Standard Library.</description>

      <description>Anatomy of Ferret Working with Ferret, you write your scrapers using its own declarative query language called FQL (Ferret Query Language).
Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the examples below to get a glimpse into how a Ferret query is structured.
Everything has a result Every FQL query must have either a RETURN or FOR statement.
RETURN &amp;#34;foobar&amp;#34; FOR i IN 1..10 RETURN i + 2 Functions are essential Writing FQL scripts always involves calling functions.</description>

      <description>Syntax Query types An FQL query must return a result indicated by usage either of the RETURN or FOR IN keywords. The FQL parser will return an error if it cannot find any of these two statements.
Whitespace Whitespaces (blanks, carriage returns, line feeds, and tab stops) can be used in the query text to increase its readability. Tokens have to be separated by any number of whitespaces. Whitespace within strings or names must be enclosed in quotes in order to be preserved.</description>

      <description>Data types FQL supports both primitive data types consisting of exactly one value and compound data types comprised of multiple values. The following types are available:
  Data type Description     none An empty value, also: the absence of a value   boolean Boolean truth value with possible values false and true   integer Signed whole number   float Signed floating point number   string UTF-8 encoded text value   array Sequence of values, referred to by their positions   object Sequence of values, referred to by their names   binary Sequence of binary values   custom User defined types    Primitive types None value A none value can be used to represent an empty or absent value.</description>

      <description>Installation Even though, Ferret comes as a CLI executable, it also can be used as a library.
CLI From binary You can download latest binaries from here.
From the source go get github.com/MontFerret/ferret Library go get github.com/MontFerret/ferret/pkg/compiler Environment In order to use all Ferret features, you will need to have Chrome either installed locally or running in Docker. For ease of use we recommend to run Chrome inside a Docker container:</description>

      <description>Quick start Browserless mode If you want to play with FQL and check its syntax, you can run CLI with the following commands to run Ferret CLI in REPL mode:
